// Maker.jsx will contain all of our code for the application that shows up once the user
// has logged in. Login.js will handle everything before the user is logged in, like the login
// and signup screens. Helper.js will contain a number of helpful functions that both files
// will import.** (does this mean login.jsx instead of login.js)**
